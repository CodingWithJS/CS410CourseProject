"Rand was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!"
"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions."
Good class
"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something."
"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with Rand and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C."
"Steven Rand is a nice person and really interesting to hear him speak. I am always inspired after a lecture. However, never expect to get anything higher than a C. You can think your paper is perfect but, he will tear it apart in seconds. Take a different professor if you don't want to put 9 hours of work into a paper you get an 'average' grade on."
Hard class 
He graded a 100 level class like we were all English majors in a 300 or above level class. Never got higher than a C on a paper. I went to the writing center for every paper. Very unclear in instructions and hard to approach with questions. Don't take the class from him.
Tough grader on papers make sure you do your work and drafts. Participation grades save you in the long run. Dont miss class and do your work. Go to the tutor center helps alot
Do not take English 110 with Rand. I don't feel any better at writing due to his confusing grading style. 
Bottom line Rand needs to retire before he ruins everyone's GPA's.  He thinks he knows so much about English and thinks it is his job to make essay assignments unneeded riddles.  He answers questions with questions and likes to talk trash about high school English teachers; hating on the high school teachers ironically makes it like high school. FR
He will only give your paper a C. It does not matter if it is good or not. Work extremely hard if you plan on passing.
one of the worst professors at UND. Extremely hard grader and expects to much in a 100 level class. Thinks that everyone's papers should be masterpieces. No matter how long i spent on a paper i couldnt get higher than a C. Only reason i got a B in the class was because i never missed a class. 
"This class is so pointless its ridiculous.  I'm in the class currently (only because its required.) The class has no relevance to anything in life.  Rand is a ****, the class is so boring. He could make the class so much better by writing papers that actually have meaning to  them instead of what some philosopher said.  Textbook reading is hard!!  "
Horrible professor. He does not believe in A's.  Thinks that other teachers grade too easily.  Answers your questions with other questions that do not help you.  Teaches you irrelevant material that you will never use again. Worst professor I have ever had.
"Worst professor ever. He asked me personal questions that were uncomfortable, made me feel stupid when I asked questions, and overall discouraged me. Do not take english 125 from him."
"I attend his Business and Technical Writing course. Rand humiliates people for not understanding assignments when they ask. Very egotistical, rude to those who need help, very difficult work, hard grader -even on those who are following directions. I highly recommend waiting to take this class from anyone else. Not worth losing points on your GPA."
"He was a very hard grader, but he graded on improvement throughout the semester, not on how great of a  greater you were (I mean he obviously graded on how good of a writer you were, but it was more on how much you progressed). I learned a lot from him. I am even taking me next english class with him. Definitely take his course if you can!"
"Professor Steven Rand is very unclear and grades very hard. If you are in his English classes, drop if you want something less than a C. He hates that 'students were graded too easy in high school' so in response to that, he likes to fail his students."
"He is terrible! If you have him drop him IMMEDIATELY! He is mean, and an extremely hard grader!!!!"
Awful. Horrible grading.
I wish I could give him a zero
Not good.
"This was a tough class. I expected all college classes to be like this, but since most are not it was somewhat refreshing to have a professor push me this much. If you are willing to put in the work for Mr. Rand you will reep the benefits. If not, then take this class from someone else."
"He is a unruly professor. He grades on how he feels your ideas are. There is never a right answer, papers can ALWAYS use improvement. I would not recommend him to anyone wanting a grade over a C, even to get that you must put in an excessive amount of time into each paper."
"He is confusing in every aspect: in lecture, in assignments and in critiquing. His assignments are mundane and never change.  I expected to explore writing and become better.  He is an impossible grader, espcially because he grades on how HE feels about your ideas, not on grammer or content.  VERY DISAPPOINTING."
Nice
worst experience of my life. expects way too much for a 100 level course. take this class if you want to spend 15 hours on a three page paper and still get a C-. ridiculous grading policies.
"For as much of a waste as UNIV 101 is, he did an ok job at keeping things interesting.  Avoid UNIV 101 altogether if you can."
"His expectations are high for a required 100-level class, especially since most who take it aren't English majors. To his credit, he's smart and gives good feedback. I wouldn't recommend him to a freshman."
